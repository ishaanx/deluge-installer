# Automated installation of Deluge server on Ubuntu 16.04.3

This script installs the latest Deluge webui on your Ubuntu server. 

It also connects the webUI with deluge daemon automatically. 

So you don't need to click connect everytime you start webUI. 

The webUI password is 'deluge'. 

The script asks for a password and username, which is different than the webUI password.

The username and password is used for connecting a local deluge client to the server.
